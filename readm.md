Javascript project:

HTML and CSS was already done, so they send me this templeta to set the Javascript

It`s a refunde system. You will set the name of the user, select the item and price.

Javascrip steps:

-Validate the input so that it only accepts numbers [x]
-formatting the currency [x]
-Getting the infos from the form, create an objetc for the items [x]
-Create a function responsible to add a item in the list []
